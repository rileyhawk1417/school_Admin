The website is meant for school administrators to check on student fees, organise accounts and possibly store student grades. 

## Technical Specification üîß
- The site is meant to use passportjs to authenticate credentials or perhaps run the postgresql database.
- With a different database running it should be able to store student records such as account balances like fees.
- The site is meant to use nodejs server in order to manage the webpages and otther possible libraries.
